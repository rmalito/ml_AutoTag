Run This Town
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
"Run This Town" is a song by American rapper Jay-Z. The
song also features Kanye West and Rihanna. It was written by
the performing trio, with assistance from Ernest Wilson and Jeff
Bhasker. Production of the track was made by West and Wilson
(also known as "No I.D.").[1] "Run This Town" was released as
the second single from Jay-Z's eleventh studio album The
Blueprint 3, and is used as the theme song of Battlefield 4.[2]
"Run This Town" received mixed reviews from music critics;
some praised what each member of the trio brought to the track,
whilst others thought that Kanye West and Rihanna outperformed
Jay-Z. The song was a commercial success, reaching
number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the charts in
the United Kingdom. It additionally made top ten chartings in
ten other countries including in Australia, Norway, Sweden, and
Switzerland.
"Run This Town" won Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung
Collaboration at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. The song's
accompanying music video, directed by Anthony Mandler,
depicts the trio in a post-apocalyptic environment, featuring
scenes involving angry protesters surrounding them. "Run This
Town" was performed by Jay-Z, West, and Rihanna on the series
premiere of The Jay Leno Show in the United States.[3][4]

The second official single from the album, The Blueprint 3
was originally planned to be "Off That" featuring Drake but
"Run This Town" was decided upon instead. Jay-Z confirmed
the release in an interview with Tim Westwood, saying, "We
basically run this town. It's myself, Rihanna and Kanye. It's
pretty much it."[6] The song made its radio debut on July 24,
2009 at 9:11am to coincide with the album's release date,
September 11, 2009.[7] "Run This Town" was officially
released to urban radios in the United States on August 9,
2009[8] and was released via iTunes worldwide two days later
on August 11. The CD single release followed on August 31, 2009 in the UK.[9] Rihanna's contribution was her
first musical appearance following her February 8 altercation with her ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, earlier that
year.[10]
Reception
Critical reception
"Run This Town" received mixed reviews from music critics. Following the leak of the song, Tom Breihan,
Pitchfork gave a positive review. "The new Jay-Z/Kanye West/Rihanna track from 'The Blueprint 3', leaked this
morning, and it bangs. Jay's 'D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)' left the impression that The Blueprint 3 might be a
cantankerous grumpy-old-man rap album, but 'Run This Town' totally obliterates that. Thanks to a molten
motivational Rihanna chorus, it's pop-friendly as hell, without compromising Jay's fundamental hardness. And Jay
is actually rapping like he cares, something he's only done intermittently over the last few years. Still, Kanye gets
the hottest line on the song: 'What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' RAV 4?'"[11] Following the album's release,
Pitchfork made another review of the song, again praising the track. "There's something for everybody: Jay [-Z]
sounds engaged in a way he rarely has since unretiring, Rihanna coos those "ay ay"s the radio loves, and Kanye
West, as you may have read, once again upstages the guy he's producing. Rihanna's hook may not be Auto-Tune'd,
but it's definitely autopilot."[12]
About.com felt that Jay-Z lacked presence, writing, "It looks like someone finally got tired of being bullied by 'Big
Brother'. Roc Nation dropped the ball on the song credit though; it was supposed to read 'Kanye West Featuring
Rihanna,' because 'Ye murdered Jay on his own track. But that's not saying much because Jay was running this race
on one foot. In other words, Kanye didn't win, Jay lost".[13] Digital Spy gave a mixed review of the song.
"Boasting three of the biggest stars from the worlds of hip-hop and R&B, 'Run This Town' was never going to be a
flop, but neither is it a roaring success. Kanye's slick rapping ("Reebok baby, you need to try some new things,
have you ever had shoes without shoestrings?") and Rihanna's "hey-hey" chorus hook make Jay-Z seem surplus to
requirements, which surely can't have been the aim. The chaotic military march beats are impressive – and hats off
to Jigga for snubbing Auto-Tune – but this track still doesn't seem fitting of an artist considered a groundbreaking
rap legend.[14]
Accolades
Most notably, "Run This Town" was nominated for Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 52nd
Grammy Awards in 2010. It eventually won both awards, marking Jay-Z's tenth, Kanye West's fourteenth, and
Rihanna's third win at the ceremony awards in total. The song also managed to win an Emmy Award for
'Outstanding Music Composition/Direction/Lyrics', during Super Bowl XLIV.[15]

Music video
Background
The video for "Run This Town" was directed by Anthony Mandler and was filmed on August 6, 2009 at Fort
Totten Park in New York City. Mandler explained the production behind the video saying:
"There's a tone and feeling to the song, there's a militia, a march and a kind of rambunctious energy to
it that, for me, I immediately wanted to tap into. I showed [Jay] some references from the classic
rebellious zones of the world. We live in very orderly society in America, but when you get into
Brazil, you get into the Middle East, you get into Africa, you get into Eastern Europe, when you get
into places like that, there's a different sort of 'we run this town' [going on]. There's less order and
more chaos. So we looked at a lot of those references, new photos and historical photos, to capture that
kind of falling-apart feeling." "We wanted you to feel uneasy throughout the piece," he said. "We
wanted there to be a constant layer of tension through the piece. Even in the way I shot — where the
camera comes by Jay, it doesn't stop on him, it goes to Rihanna — there's kind of this chaos of
revealing and covering and concealing. And things happen offscreen that you don't see. I think people
are really gonna flip on this".
The video was leaked on August 19, 2009, by MTV Germany. It premiered officially on August 20 on MTV, as
well other MTV channels across the world. The video was released to iTunes on August 25, 2009.
Synopsis and reception
The music video involves crowds of protesters in masks, holding torches whilst walking. Rihanna takes a
bandanna from covering her mouth and performs the intro of the song in a park area with explosions firing around
her. Jay-Z then begins the second verse while in a temple-like area. Kanye West sings his verse in a cave-like area
holding a torch and having a bandanna cover his face like Jay-Z and Rihanna. Throughout the video, the trio are on
a stage platform with the mob of protesters previously shown surrounding them.
Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone called the video, "a civilization that takes Jigga's lyrical motif of 'all black
everything' very seriously." He further added, "When we first heard 'Run This Town', we pictured Jay-Z and his
posse staging a siege on Manhattan, or at least going to all the VIP spots most civilians only dream about like in
the "D.O.A. (Death of Autotune)" video. Instead, we're introduced to a Mad Max-like landscape full of proto-biker
gear, torches, face scarves and bombed-out buildings. Jay-Z and his gang of ruffians actually look like they're on a
mission to slay Auto-Tune. Also, according to the video, Rihanna is the only female to survive the apocalypse, and
West's verse about Reeboks, Rav4s and girls with two bee stings seem starkly out of place in the dismal future."[42]
It ranked at number eleven on BET's Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.
Remixes and cover versions
On July 20, 2010, an orchestrated version of "Run This Town" created by E.S. Posthumus was officially released
to US iTunes under the Roc Nation imprint, in its studio format. This was eventually played before Super Bowl
XLIV and Nashville Predators playoff games.[43] Metalcore band Miss May I covered this song for the
compilation album Punk Goes Pop 3.
Lil Wayne Freestyled Run This Town on his highly acclaimed Mixtape No Ceilings.

Usage in media
"Run this Town" has been used in video games, such as NBA 2K13 (whose music always featured Jay-Z) and the
teaser for Battlefield 4. It was to be included in coverage of Thursday Night Football on CBS and the NFL
Network in 2014, however, it was pulled from the opening segment in the first broadcast in the wake of a domestic
violence controversy involving NFL player Ray Rice.[96][97] After Rihanna took to Twitter to complain, the song
was removed from further games.[98]
